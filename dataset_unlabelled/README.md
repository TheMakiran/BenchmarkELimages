The dropbox contains over 150,000 cell-level EL images cropped from 2,573 module-level EL images. Over 2,000 of those images were sourced from one module supplier during the construction of a 911 kWp DC rooftop installation at the CSIR commissioned in 2018. The unlabelled cell-level images can used for training semi-supervised and self-supervised models. They can als be used to create additional ground truth images for fully-supervised models.
