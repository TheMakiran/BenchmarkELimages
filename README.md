# Benchmark datasets for defect detection in EL images of solar cells using semantic segmentation
This site hosts benchmark datasets for multi-class semantic segmentation of electroluminescence (EL) imagess of silicon wafer-based solar cells. Labelled and unlabelled images are provided. The datasets consist of EL images of solar cells originating from three (3) private and two (2) public sources. The three private sources include: 1) The CSIR Energy Centre, a PV module test lab in South Africa where the research and development was conducted ; 2) CFV Labs, a PV module test lab in the United States; and 3) ARTsolar, a PV module manufacturer in South Africa. The public dataset includes images selected from the larger datasets previously publishded by CWRU SDLE Research Center and ZAE Bayern. Please, cite the papers listed below when using these datasets in your own work.

# Sample images
The 'dataset_20211104' folder contains the original labelled dataset with twenty-four (24) classes: twelve (12) intrinsic features of wafer-based solar cells and twelve (12) extrinsic defects. The datasets contain a roughly equal number of images from multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline cells. The subsequent datasets include additional images, additional classes, and corrections to earlier versions of the same images.  The 'ListOfClassesAndColorCodes.csv' included in each database directory lists the classes along with the unique RGB index used to label the ground truth masks. 

Some examples of the EL images and corresponding ground truth masks are shown below.

# Folder structure for labelled datasets
Each folder with labelled datasets has the same subfolders for EL images (train, val, test), ground truth masks (train, val, test), and the full-color (RGB) masks that were manually annotated using GIMP. The train subfolders include the original images/masks and augmented images/masks that were generated by flipping, rotating, and mirroring the originals. The ground truth masks contain an index from 0 to c-1 for each pixel, where c is the number of classes in the dataset. The index corresponds to the RGB color assigned to the class in the GIMP image. '0' is assigned to the background class colored black in the RGB images.  The color to index mapping for all classes is detailed in the csv file included in each subfolder. 

- dataset_YYYYMMDD
  - el_images_test   # el images for testing
  - el_images_train  # el images for training
  - el_images_val    # el images for validation
  - el_masks_rgb     # RGB ground truth masks for all EL images in the train, val, test folders
  - el_masks_test    # indexed ground truth masks for testing
  - el_masks_train   # indexed ground truth masks for testing
  - el_masks_val     # indexed ground truth masks for testing
 
# Folder structure for module dataset
The 'dataset_modules' folder consists of 329 module-level EL images. These images can be cropped to create over 20,000 additional cell-level images. The unlabelled cell-level images can used for training semi-supervised and self-supervised models. They can als be used to create additional ground truth images for fully-supervised models.
