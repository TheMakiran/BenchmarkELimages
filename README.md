# Benchmark dataset for semantic segmentation
This site hosts a benchmark dataset for multi-class semantic segmentation of electroluminescence (EL) imagess of silicon wafer-based solar cells. The original dataset was created on 2021-11-04 and used in a paper submission. [reference] The dataset consists of 593 EL images of solar cells originating from three (3) private and two (2) public sources [https://osf.io/4qrtv/] [https://github.com/zae-bayern/elpv-dataset] with a roughly equal number of multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline wafers. 

There are twenty-four (24) classes labelled in the original dataset: twelve (12) intrinsic features of wafer-based solar cells and twelve (12) extrinsic defects. The 'ListOfClassesAndColorCodes.csv' lists the 24 classes along with the unique RGB codes used to label the ground truth masks. 

Some examples of the EL image and corresponding ground trugh images are shown below.
